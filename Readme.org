#+title: Python learning notes

/Just wanted to have remote copy of my learning notes. Not much advanced, as of the time of writing this./

I use nixos, so having flake for specified channels is good and also let it manage all packages and libraries!
Benefit of using flake here is, you will have the same exact (100%) setup like I have, same versions of everything. That is what *flake.lock* is for.

+ Development shell with mentioned packages via flakes
#+begin_src shell
  # option 1: with no cloning of repo
  nix develop "github:idlip/py-code"

  # option 2: inside local clone directory
  nix develop
#+end_src
