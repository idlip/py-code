# play strings

'simple life'
"simple life"

# python is so smart that it makes the delimiting single quote as double
# since I have used an single quote by escaping
'life\'s simple'
"life is \"simple\"" # makes it single quote here

# but you can use other quote freely, no need to escape
'life is "simple"'
"life's simple"

# weird part: think yourself
'"life\'s simple"'

# Note: I did not use print() function
# Print function smartly show us clean output
print('"life\'s simple"')

# You can go raw (r) with nothing to act upon
print(r'"Z:\home\user"')
